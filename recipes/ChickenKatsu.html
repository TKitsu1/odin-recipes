        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>What is Chicken Katsu? Katsu is a very popular Japanese comfort food made up of breaded cutlets of 
                chicken or pork mostly. The secret is having a crispy golden brown outside while still having a juicy 
                tender inside. Katsu dishes are traditionally served with katsu sauce drizzled on top of the meat with a side of 
                crunchy shredded cabbage and steamed rice.
