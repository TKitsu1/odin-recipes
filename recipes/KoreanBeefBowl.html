        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ever want Bulgogi but you're feeling a tad lazy? Look no further than the Korean beef bowl. This recipe is 
            pretty much the faster and cheaper version of it. Rather than letting the Bulgogi marinate overnight you
            can have the same amazing taste in 15 mins. Tonight why not have a little KBBQ in a bowl.
             This is a fail-proof recipe that anyone can make!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                    <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
                    <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup light brown sugar </li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper </li>
                    <li>6 green onions, chopped, divided </li>
                    <li>4 cups hot cooked white or brown (look at you being healthy) rice </li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>

                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring and breaking it up
                        into small pieces until finally browned. This should take 5-7 minutes. Drain excess grease.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add ginger,garlic, and sesame oil, stirring until fragrant. This should take about 2 minutes. Stir in 
                        your soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. Cook until the sauce is partially absorbed into the beef.
                        This should take about 7 minutes. Then add half of the chopped green onions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve beef over the hot rice; garnished with sesame seeds and the other half of the green onions.</li>
                    <li>Most importantly enjoy!</li>
